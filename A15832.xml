         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore hath the Creator proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the beginning both the creatures and the meanes for mans delight, yet with a difference to man therein for ſome of his ſeruants to exceed the reſt, that they may haue ſuppeditaments and ornaments of life, <hi>ad bene &amp; melius eſſe,</hi> for recreation ſake, which haue beene euer by the beſt ſpirits deſired: For how baſe and vnworthy a mind ſhould that man haue, being borne or aduanced to good poſſesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; fortunes, that ſhould ſubiect himſelfe to the drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and ſlauerie of the earth in meere matter of getting and coueting, as if he were the true childe of <hi>Adam,</hi> only in that necesſitated qualitie of digging his liuing out of the earth, whereunto he was by God curſed, and ſo ſhould in nothing

elſe bee eleuated to more worthy conſideration of better things inſtituted by the Creator? For as the all diſpoſer by order &amp; gouernment vpon earth hath appointed in euery Monarchy (being the beſt gouernment) degrees of honor &amp; difference of ranks and qualities amongſt men, ſo he hath to them in their ſeueral places and eſtimation thereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed all ſuch other outward ſupplies of pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights as are fit for ſuch men, as <hi>Deere, Stagge, Cony, Pheaſant, Partridge,</hi> and the like; yet ſo as the wiſedome of this and other ciuilized Kingdomes hath been ſuch, as it hath giuen a more abſolute power and priuiledge therein to the King, then to any man, though they are called to bee <hi>feræ na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turæ,</hi> they are ſaid more properly to be the Kings then any mans, as by waie of intereſt by reaſon of his prerogatiue, of giuing the ſubiect liberty to incloſe &amp; conteine them in each mans ſeuerall ground, by Parkes and Warrens, &amp;c. and to giue an intereſt and propertie to man therein to hunt, hawke, and chaſe them by licence in each mans own poſſeſſion, and to diſtreine others from it, as ſhall appeare from time to time by the lawes of this Kingdome collected in this ſhort diſcourſe. But becauſe it is the common hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of men to caſt there eie onely vpon that thing that tendeth to matter of profit, or at leaſt much more then pleaſure and other contentment, and for that theſe maner of priuiledges of Free Warren, and the like, being the Kings Graces and deriuatiues from the prerogatiue of the Crowne, are not ſo well and vſually vnderſtood, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to bee meere matter of pleaſure, and not of benefit or profit, being not in the common vſe among men; it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene a thing ſo deintie and precious to be had heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and ſo rarely granted, that ſubiects of the greateſt and wiſeſt ſort of all rankes haue beene ſpeciall ſutors in all ages, to the Kings and Queens of this kingdome to obteine it, as may appeare by ſeuerall graunts from time to time.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2944:3"/>
And that no man may bee ignorant, aſwell of the benefit and profit, and preſent neceſſarie vſe of it, aſwell as the pleaſure of it; I thought it not vnfit to ſet downe a ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or briefe repetorie of ſome of the Lawes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the vſe and practiſe thereof from time to time in this caſe; whereby it ſhall appeare, that by comparing our preſent with the times paſt, by the number of Parkes and increaſe of game of all ſorts, and the preſent ſtate of this Kingdome, there will be much more vſe and necesſitie hereof in theſe times to all men, then in former; and doubt not but to giue ſatisfaction that the profit and vſe heereof ſhall be great to all men for whom it is fit; who haue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Waſtes, Commons, Parke, or Warren, and the like, not licenſed by his Maieſtie or his predeceſſors grant: For that to thoſe who haue Waſtes, Lands, and Grounds barrened by Corne, or ſo by nature, the profit thereof may ariſe as the occaſion ſhall be, and to thoſe that haue Parkes and Warrens vnlicenſed, his Maieſties Writ of <hi>Quo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> may and doth iuſtly lie, being no more reaſon that any Subiect ſhould vſurpe a priuiledge proper and of right belonging to the King, then hee theirs; and without this priuiledge or graunt what recompence men vſually haue vpon euery Action of Treſpaſſe brought for killing Deere, Conies, or the like, euerie mans experience teacheth him to his loſſe. Why then, what incouragement can any man haue to plant or reduce to ſeueraltie Warren or Parke vpon his waſte or lands fit for it, which may happlie be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie profitable, when being not licenſed vpon any ſpoile, killing or taking the Game, hee cannot iuſtifie his Action againſt him for the ſame, nor recouer damage; but as in an ordinarie Action of Treſpaſſe, for comming vpon the ground, which how poore a recompence it is for a mans loſſe, men do daily feele. All which ſhal ſufficiently appeare by the collection of the Lawes heerein: So as I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,

And it is reſolued that in ſome things which are wilde by nature a man hath right of propertie, and in ſome of them he hath a right of priuiledge; and that there are three maners of rights of properties, to wit, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, abſolute, propertie qualified, and propertie poſſeſſory; propertie abſolute a man hath not in any thing which is wilde by nature, but in thoſe onely which are tame by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; propertie qualified and poſſeſſorie a man may haue in things which are wilde by nature, and may atteine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto two waies; by induſtry, and by reaſon of their diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and of the place; by induſtry, as by taking of them and making them tame; but in thoſe a man hath but a qualified propertie ſo long as they remaine tame, for if they get their former libertie &amp; haue not <hi>animum reuertendi,</hi> the property is loſt by reaſon of impotency and of the place. As where a man hath young Hernſhawes, Goſhawkes or the like,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2944:4"/>
which are by nature wilde and do Eyre in his ground, there hee hath a poſſeſſory property in them, for in that caſe the owner ſhall haue Treſpaſſe, for breaking his Wood and taking away his Hawkes, &amp;c. of ſuch a price; But when a man hath wilde beaſts, <hi>ratione priuilegij</hi> which growes by the Kings graunt or preſcription, as by reaſon of a Manor, Parke, &amp;c. he hath no property in the Deere, Conies, Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants or Partridges without the Kings graunt: For in a Treſpaſſe hee ſhall declare for entring into his Parke, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, &amp;c. and ſo many Deere, Conies, Hares, Pheſants, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, &amp;c. and ſhall not ſtay him; for he hath no proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in them, but they belong to him <hi>ratione priuilegij,</hi> for his game and pleaſure ſo long as they remaine in the place priuiledged, and the heires ſhal haue them, and not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors. By this it appeares that if a man haue none of theſe properties in any wilde beaſts by nature, he cannot maintaine Action for taking them away, and ſo is the Booke expreſly: For a man cannot preſcribe to haue all Pheſants and Partridges building, breeding, and vſing within his Manors, but muſt preſcribe or plead that hee hath a Free VVarren of them within his Manors.</p>
